     * Real world example -
     * PROBLEM -
     * A users clicks on button and it will call a api (2-3 seconds)
     * What if he/she clicks again and again continuously on that button.
     * Api will calls continuously in weired behaviour. That will kill the system.
     *
     * SOLUTION -
     * If you know, what is concurrency and how to handle concurrency or how to structure
     * concurrency in a way that do something great with full control.
     *
     * What is concurrency?
     * Concurrency means handling more than one task. It's simple as that.
     * Running more than one task is concurrency.
     *
     * Concurrency Patterns -
     * 1. Cancel the previous task before staring new
     * 2. Queue the next work and wait for previous task to complete and then start new one
     * 3. Join Previous work, if there is already a running task, then return it, instead of
     *    creating new one.
